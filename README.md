# Freecam
[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/freecam/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/freecam)

This mod allows you to control your camera separately from your player. While it is enabled, you can fly around and travel through blocks within your render distance. Disabling it will restore you to your original position. This can be useful for quickly inspecting builds and exploring your world. 

This mod works in multiplayer, but may be considered cheating on some servers.
It is your responsibility to check **all** relevant rules **before** using this mod.

While Freecam should only affect the client, it **may be possible** for servers to detect the mod being installed through various exploits in Minecraft,
modding platforms, or this mod.  
Here's a [real example](https://github.com/MinecraftFreecam/Freecam/issues/196) that exploited translation keys. 

To paraphrase our license, we are not responsible for any damages or liability related to Freecam.
Among other things, this means it's not our fault if you get banned from a server.
Here's the [full license](./LICENSE).

## Addendum

This is a **FORK** of Hashalite's freecam mod. I added a command `/freecam_enable [player]` which gives the player a custom item that's needed for freecam to work. This is a non-intrusive solution to "server-side" control of a client-side mod's freecam capabilities. *Intended to be used with modpacks!*

\*The freecam bind can also be used in conjunction with any of the hotbar keys (`F4` + `1`...`9`) to enter "tripod" mode. This enables you to set up multiple cameras with differing perspectives, and switch between them at will.
